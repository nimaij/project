Data Science Project Plan

KEY INFORMATION
y-variable: funded (1) or (expired)

Data variations 
- All loan data
- All loan data + country data
- All loan data + country data + partner data 
- All loan data + country data + partner data + text clustering on loan_use variable

PLAN
1. Data visualitions to give an overview of the data
overview
* loan count: by country, by year, by sector

status_bin
* by country (map)
* by year
* by sector
* by country by year (map)

2. Clean data
* clear columns that have lots of nas
* drop rows of variables you want that have nas

3. Logistic Regression
> Run a logistic regression for each vairable-> see which variable is the best predictor
> Run a logistic regression with all variables-> see which variables are the most important
> Get features from this and use for decision trees

4. Decision Tree
* Create decision tree
* Evaluate (accuracy score and ROC)
* Finetuning the tree
* Compare against logistic

5. Random Forest
- create RF (likely to give better results than DT)
- Evaluate (accuracy score and ROC)
- Finetuning
- Compare against Logistic + Decision tree

6. Applying clustering analysis to loan data
* Clean data
* Create document-term matrix
* Apply LDA model
* Visualisation

7. Conclusions

OTHER ITEMS
Things to consider:
- Skewed dependent variable: does it affect my model and results?
- Make sure you define what you are predicting (trying to predict funded or expired?)

Other ideas:
- Restrict sameple to after the 30 day expiry got introduced (gets rid of unhelpful data)
-  Alternative y-variable
    Using funded data: time it took to fund as
    Using expired data: share of loan that was funded
- Recommendation engines for recommending loans to particular lenders 
- Applying clustering analysis to loan data
